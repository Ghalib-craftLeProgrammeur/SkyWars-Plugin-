# SkyWars Bukkit Plugin

## Description
SkyWars Bukkit Plugin is a Minecraft minigame plugin that allows players to participate in exciting PvP battles in the sky. Players are teleported to an arena where they must gather resources, fight other players, and be the last one standing to win the game.

## Features
- Queue system: Players can join a queue to wait for a new game to start.
- Randomized loot chests: Chests containing various items and equipment are scattered throughout the arena, providing players with resources to gear up for battle.
- Countdown timer: A countdown timer starts when players are teleported to the arena, giving them time to prepare before the game begins.
- Team-based gameplay: Players can be divided into teams, and the winning team is determined based on the last team standing or the last player alive.
- NPC summoning: Server administrators can summon NPCs to provide information or interact with players.
